MATH480-Project
===============
As of right my final project will probably have something to do Linear Programming.  
I am not exactly sure what I want to do but it might just be experimenting with different  
methods of passing the many different parameters needed to describe LP's. So far I've  
seen cvxopt and MILP. They both take inputs (and display outputs) differently.  
I'll probably just end up making different wrapper classes with the goal of making the  
process of solving LP's simpler.
